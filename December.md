# Things to do in December / Vactions / Free Time
 
Here is an NON-EXHAUSTIVE list of things which an UG1 student, or anyone willing to take a dip in the vast and fruitful world of Open-Source Development can take on, since there is time in December to at least get something started.

## 1. Learn a new language:
There are many different websites available that can help you do this.
My favorite is CodeAcademy
But any that makes you actually code instead of just throwing video lectures and quizes at you is fine. (here is a small [list](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/sites-to-learn-coding-online/)

I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST AGAINST PAYING FOR ANY CS COURSE, RIGHT NOW. 
99.9% of this material is available for free.

## 2. Participate in Open Source "Winter of Code":
We couldn't get our own winter of code off the ground this year but that does not mean you should not get participate in others similar things by other organizations at other colleges.

## 3. Competitive Programming:
If you like to do Competitive Programming, like the problems in UG1 CPro Assignments, then again there are a lot of different websites to hone your skills. 
[IIIT-H Programming Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/267448629933046) (for IIIT Hyderabad Students Only) is a better place to seek guidance.

## 4. Web Dev is boring? 
Say you want to be a game developer? Where do you even start?!

Here are some roadmaps that actually help you figure out WHAT to learn.

Keep in mind that these are very broad and a lot of topics are mentioned. These are suggestions on what you should know about to start a new job. You probably have a few years to complete all these and might not need to complete them at all.
